## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harishdeivanayagam/rowfill
```



2. Configure environment variables:
   - Reference the sample environment variables in [mockenv](https://github.com/harishdeivanayagam/rowfill/tree/master/mockenv)
   - Create your `.env` file based on the mockenv template

## Third-Party Requirements

You'll need to set up the following:

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI functionality
- **SMTP Service**: Choose one of:
  - AWS SES
  - Resend
  - Similar email service

Note: The following services are automatically installed via Docker Compose:
- Weaviate
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

## System Components

Rowfill consists of three main modules:

1. **Next.js Server**: Main web application
2. **Worker**: Background processing
3. **CRON Job**: Scheduled tasks

## Deployment

Run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


This command will:
- Set up all required databases
- Start all three system components
- Configure networking between services

## Verification

To verify your installation:

1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Check Docker container status:

```bash
docker ps
```

This should show all three containers running.
